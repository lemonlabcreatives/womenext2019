                            <p><strong>Adherence to Data Privacy Act</strong></p>
                            <p>The Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) recognizes its responsibilities under the Republic Act No. 10173, or the
                            Data Privacy Act of 2012, its implementing rules and regulations, and the official circulars and issuances of the National Privacy
                            Commission (collectively referred to herein as “Privacy Laws”) in protecting the privacy and security of personal data collected from MAP
                            members and non-members who attend MAP events. MAP adheres to the principles and complies with the data privacy practices
                            provided in the Privacy Laws.</p>

                            <p><strong>Collection of Personal Data</strong></p>

                            system and are only accessed by authorized MAP employees.</p>

                            <p><strong>Processing of Personal Data</strong></p>
                            <p>The data collected and stored in the MAP database are used only for the following purposes under certain conditions as required
                            by the Data Privacy Act: (1) Promotion of activities sponsored or supported by MAP; (2) Inviting MAP members and non-members to
                            participate in MAP’s activities and advocacy programs; and (3) Determining the profile of the MAP membership.</p>

                            <p><strong>Non-Disclosure of Personal Data</strong></p>
                            <p>MAP does not disclose personal information without the consent of MAP members or concerned non-members, or in any
                            circumstance not authorized by the Privacy Laws.</p>

                            <p>MAP retains the data from MAP members as long as they continue their membership in the MAP and those from non-members
                            as long as they continue attending MAP activities; but in any event not longer than two years from the date of termination of membership
                            (in case of a MAP member) or one year from date the last activity attended (in case of a non-member).</p>

                            <p><strong>Security of Personal Data</strong></p>
                            <p>MAP implements reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organization security measures to protect the personal
                            information from unauthorized access, processing, use, or disclosure.</p>

                            <p><strong>Rights of the Data Subjects; Updates and Inquiries</strong></p>
                            <p>MAP respects and recognizes the rights of MAP members and non-members as data subjects under the Privacy Laws. MAP
                            members and non-members may request for an updating, rectification or amendment of their personal data, as well as reach us in case
